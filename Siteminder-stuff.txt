- Input Validation: how resilient the application is to wrong/misspelt input? Whatâ€™s the feedback to the user? At the frontend, or backend or both?

- Error Handling: what feedback the user is given in case of errors? How resilient is the application to IO errors, unresponsive or slow backends?

- Technical choices: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

- Clarity: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical trade offs explained? Are install/setup instructions provided?

- Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?

- Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?

- Testing: Your code must be testable. If you run out of time and cannot add the necessary testing be prepared to answer questions so that we get a feel for your testing skills.
